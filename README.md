# Set Lab

## Learning Goals

- Create and use Sets

## Instructions

Let's extend the library with the following functionality:

1. In your library, create a set that contains a list of each genre that you
   have a book for
2. Every time the user adds a book to the library, add the book's genre to your
   new set
3. Add a new option to your loop to ask the user if they want to check if the
   library has any books of a specific genre
4. If the user selects that option, ask them for the genre they want to check
   and them let them know if the library has any books of that genre.
